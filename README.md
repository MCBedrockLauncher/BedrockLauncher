# ðŸ’º Minecraft Bedrock Launcher
The BedrockLauncher is the best launcher for **Minecraft for Windows 10/11**. As of writing, this only works for the Bedrock Edition, and does not support any non-PC platfrom. This launcher allows for you to download and install multiple versions of the game, in a nice clean format. It has multiple language support, nice UI, and even a Getting Started section for new, unexperienced users. Also, we allow you to edit in-game files, allowing for use of cosmetics. Finally, we natively support injector clients, like [Onix Client](https://github.com/OnixClientMC/), which is an amazing client with many mods.
